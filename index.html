<!-- Child Safety Standards Section -->
<h1>Child Safety Standards</h1>
<p>doit - The easy event planner is committed to providing a safe environment for all users, including minors. This document outlines our policies and procedures for ensuring child safety within our application.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Content Moderation</h2>
    <p>doit employs a private-by-default social model that inherently reduces risks to minors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are no public posts or public content feeds in the application</li>
        <li>All user interactions require explicit friend connections</li>
        <li>Users must accept friend requests before any communication or content sharing can occur</li>
        <li>This closed network approach significantly reduces exposure to harmful content from unknown users</li>
        <li>We review reported content within 24 hours and take appropriate action based on our terms of service</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Reporting Inappropriate Content</h2>
    <p>Users can report child safety concerns and inappropriate content:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email reporting: All content and safety concerns can be reported directly to our dedicated email: doit.app.contact@gmail.com</li>
        <li>All reports are reviewed within 24 hours by our team</li>
        <li>Severe violations, especially those involving child safety, are prioritized and addressed immediately</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>CSAM Prevention and Response</h2>
    <p>doit maintains a zero-tolerance policy for Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and related content:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We immediately review all reports related to potential CSAM</li>
        <li>Any confirmed CSAM is removed, the account is terminated, and the case is reported to the appropriate national authorities in compliance with local laws</li>
        <li>We cooperate fully with law enforcement investigations related to CSAM</li>
        <li>Our closed network system (requiring friend approval) significantly reduces the risk of CSAM distribution</li>
        <li>We maintain records of all CSAM reports and actions taken in accordance with legal requirements</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Age Considerations</h2>
    <p>While our app does not currently implement technical age verification, we are committed to maintaining an age-appropriate environment:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Our Terms of Service prohibit use by individuals under 13 years of age</li>
        <li>We respond promptly to reports of underage users</li>
        <li>Parents or guardians can report underage accounts to doit.app.contact@gmail.com</li>
        <li>We remove accounts confirmed to belong to users under 13 years of age</li>
        <li>We plan to implement additional age verification measures in future updates</li>
    </ul>
